		<h3 align="left"><u>Concert Review</u>: Travis Scott - So-Fi Stadium</h3>
		<p align="left">Travis Scott made history at the SoFi Stadium on Sunday, November 5th. He brought his electrifying Utopia – Circus Maximus Tour to the stadium in Inglewood, California, and it was an experience to remember. This larger-than-life spectacle was a sensory overload, to say the least. It defied the boundaries of a traditional concert. In fact, Scott transported the audience to his world, or his UTOPIA. Complete with a stage that resembled a rock trail, an ambiance that consisted of cricket sounds, and an eerie smoke coming from the stage, it was anything but average.</p>
